Report on Dataset scraped Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy Launches Records from Wikipedia.

The dataset contains information of falcon launch records and it's used purposed. 
The data was scraped from the Wikipedia website and contains information such as 'Flight No.', 'Launch site', 'Payload',
'Payload mass', 'Orbit','Customer', 'Launch outcome', 'Date', 'Time'.

Exploratory Data Analysis:

Data Cleaning: The dataset had few missing values and was mostly unpolluted.
To fill up the vacant space, though, some data cleansing was necessary.

Summary Statistics: CCAFS has the highest launch rate with 75 times. The largest falcon 9 customer is NASA,
with SpaceX coming in second. The Falcon 9 has a maximum time and can carry a payload of more than 15,000 kg into space.
Starlink's payload has been used more than 25 times, followed by GPS II.The duration of the falcon's mission is optimal for LEO and GTO orbits.


Visualization: Visualizations such as bar, pie,area, and line charts were used to 
visualize the data and identify patterns.

Conclusion: We can learn useful details about the number of launches and the clients from the dataset of Falcon 9 launch records from Wikipedia.
The dataset gives us vital details regarding the launch sites used for each cargo and orbit. It gives us information about the mass of the payload 
that Falcon 9 can carry as well as the kind of space mission that Falcon 9 does.
